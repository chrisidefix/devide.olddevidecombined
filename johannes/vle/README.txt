DeVIDE - Delft Visualisation and Image processing Environment

This is a completely self-contained source package with which you can
build DeVIDE and all of its prerequisites.  The package contains
'johannes', the build system that makes these source packages and also
knows how to build DeVIDE from scratch.

This software has been customised for the VL-e POC.  In order to build
and install, do the following:

./configure --prefix=/some/directory/devide-abcd.wxyz
make
make install
