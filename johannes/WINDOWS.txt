As explained in the johannes README.txt, porting the first stages of
johannes (python, numpy, wxpython, matplotlib) to Windows is probably
not going to happen.   However, johannes CAN build the difficult
stuff, also automatically and nicely localised in a folder.

1. First get and install all the prerequisites:
-----------------------------------------------

* Get and install Python 2.5 from [1].  
* Get and install numpy 1.2.1 [2].
* Get and install wxpython 2.8.7.1 [3]
* Get and install matplotlib 0.98.5.2 [4]
* Get and install cmake 2.4.8 [5] and choose to add it to the system
  path (for yourself, or for all users).

[2] http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/numpy/numpy-1.2.1.win32-superpack-python2.5.msi
[3] http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.8.1-py25.exe
[4] http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/matplotlib/matplotlib-0.98.5.2.win32-py2.5.exe
[5] http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.6/cmake-2.6.2-win32-x86.exe

2. Now let johannes do its magic:
---------------------------------

python \where\you\put\it\johannes.py -w your_working_dir

Wait a few hours.  When the build is done, results are as explained in
the RESULTS section of the main johannes README.txt file.

APPENDIX:
---------

Let's say you don't really want DeVIDE, but you'd like to use johannes
to build for example just VTK and/or ITK.  You can!

Follow all instructions under 1., then do for example:

python \where\you\put\it\johannes.py -w your_working_dir -p itk,vtk

See johannes --help for clues to package names.
